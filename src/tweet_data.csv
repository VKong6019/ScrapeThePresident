Shame on @realDonaldTrump &amp; shame on his @SenateGOP allies who have done his bidding on these horrific policies. https://t.co/WksjWKr2YM"
2019-06-26 17:42:40, b'We should ban for-profit detention centers &amp; prisons. We should decriminalize migration. Parents &amp; children shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be deemed criminals for fleeing violence or seeking a better future. And we must stop family separation &amp; jailing children. Period. https://t.co/ZhPdENhQzj'
2019-06-26 17:42:40, b"We have a moral obligation to condemn &amp; end the despicable human rights abuses at detention facilities under @realDonaldTrump\xe2\x80\x99s orders. I won't support a bill that lets companies continue to profit off of jailing children &amp; allows kids to remain in unlicensed facilities."
2019-06-26 17:42:39, b'Right now, kids are locked in cages &amp; dying in US custody, @realDonaldTrump is terrorizing communities with raids &amp; mass deportation, &amp; the @WhiteHouse is threatening to veto legislation if it leaves out funding for more @ICEgov detention. Congress must fight back.'
2019-06-25 18:23:34, b'I\xe2\x80\x99m glad students cheated by shady for-profit colleges are fighting back against @BetsyDeVosED in court. If she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about helping defrauded students, then let\xe2\x80\x99s hope a federal judge will make her care. https://t.co/nJp0mwbw4S'
2019-06-25 17:01:35, b'One year ago, I was in McAllen to see the families ripped apart by the Trump admin. A year later, his administration is fighting to make sure the kids held in those cages don\xe2\x80\x99t have soap or toothbrushes. This is a humanitarian crisis, and @realDonaldTrump is responsible for it. https://t.co/93Z25Z2hxF'
2019-06-25 00:29:32, b'Climate change deniers like @VP Pence may think we can bury our heads in the sand &amp; flat-out lie that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica has the cleanest air &amp; water in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d But the climate crisis is a national security threat. https://t.co/1DDf3sSmA8'
2019-06-22 13:39:46, b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the plan is technically universal, it really does seem geared toward alleviating the current burdens of the poor and lower-middle class.\xe2\x80\x9d #UniversalChildCare https://t.co/TaXQac1eh7'
